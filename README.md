Exploration-Exploitation in Multi-Agent Learning: Catastrophe Theory Meets Game Theory

The folder Matlab.files contains all routines that we used to run the smooth Q-learning dynamics and generate the figures of the paper. The files are organized in three folders:

1. Figures_coordination_games:
    
    *test_bifurcations.m*: generates Figure 1 in the Introduction
    
    *main_coordination_surface.m*: generates the QRE surface and the exploration path for customasable exploration-exploitation policies (as described in the paper).
    The payoff matrices (see Table 1 in the paper) and the exploration policies can be fine tuned. This routine generates all subfigures in Figures 3,4 and D.11.

2. Figures_potential_dynamics:

    *main_potential_grid.m*: accepts as input a two-player potential game described by its potential matrix and outputs the plots in Figures 6 to 9. The exploration policies
    can be customized. 
    
    *plot_distribution.m*: auxiliary file to plot the shaded regions (standard deviations) in the third panels of Figures 6 to 9. Retrieved from mathworks.
    
3. Figures_potential_surface:

    *generate_potential_figures.m*: main routine to generate Figures 10 and D.12.
    
    *compute_potential.m, generate_random_directions.m*: auxiliary routines
    
    *inferno.m*: colormap retrieved from mathworks.
