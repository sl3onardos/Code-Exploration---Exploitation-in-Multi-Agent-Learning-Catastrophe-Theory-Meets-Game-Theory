Exploration-Exploitation in Multi-Agent Learning: Catastrophe Theory Meets Game Theory

The folder Matlab.files contains all routines that we used to run the smooth Q-learning dynamics and generate the figures of the paper. The files are organized in three folders:

1. Figures_coordination_games:
    
    *test_bifurcations.m*: generates Figure 1 in the Introduction
    
    *main_coordination_surface.m*: generates the QRE surface and the exploration path for customasable exploration-exploitation policies (as described in the paper).
    The payoff matrices (see Table 1 in the paper) and the exploration policies can be fine tuned. This routine generates all subfigures in Figures 3,4 and D.11.

2. Figures_potential_dynamics:

    *main_potential_grid.m*: accepts as input a two-player potential game described by its potential matrix and outputs the plots in Figures 6 to 9. The exploration policies
    can be customized. 
    
    *plot_distribution.m*: auxiliary file to plot the shaded regions (standard deviations) in the third panels of Figures 6 to 9. Retrieved from mathworks.
    
3. Figures_potential_surface:

    *generate_potential_figures.m*: main routine to generate Figures 10 and D.12.
    
    *compute_potential.m, generate_random_directions.m*: auxiliary routines
    
    *inferno.m*: colormap retrieved from mathworks.

4. Multimedia_appendix:
    
    *media_battle_of_the_sexes.m; media_stag_hunt.m*: the two main files that generate animated rotations of the QRE surfaces in these two games and produce the (static) panels
    in Figure 5. The rest of the routines in this folder contain variations of the code for different occassions.
